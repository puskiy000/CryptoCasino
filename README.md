# snake-game-VR
Snake VR is a small game that I have developed for the purpose of being the final project of the Mixed Reality course for the spring semester of 2022 at the university of Turku. This project consists of the adaptation of the classical arcade snake game to a virtual reality environment. For this, technologies from Unity were used as well as hardware technologies from HP for the virtual reality headset.
